# keys/key.txt

This folder is used to store all sensitive, environment-specific, or configuration files required by the project.

Recommended structure:

- credentials/
    - credentials.json      # API keys, secrets, tokens for Upstox or other services
- config/
    - symbols.json          # List of trading symbols and instrument keys
    - other_config.json     # Any additional configuration files
- logs/ (optional)
    - For storing log files if you want to keep them with keys (not recommended for production)

**Do NOT commit actual credentials or sensitive files to version control.**

All scripts should reference files from this folder instead of hardcoded absolute paths.
